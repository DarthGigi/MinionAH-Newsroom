At the time of writing, MinionAH has grown more than I ever imagined. We’ve passed 3,000 users and
the community keeps growing every day. I’m genuinely so grateful for all the support and love you’ve
shown.

Since day one, I’ve done everything I can to keep MinionAH completely free to use. But with growth
comes new costs. We recently had to move from our free-tier database provider to hosting our own
database because we outgrew their limits, and that’s just one example.

## Why Donations?

I want MinionAH to always stay free. But running and maintaining it comes with expenses: hosting,
domain registration, scaling infrastructure, and other operational costs. While I’ve personally
covered the domain cost so far (about $10/year), we’re reaching a point where the project needs more
to keep up.

## What Will Donations Be Used For?

Most donations will go directly into MinionAH-covering server expenses, upgrades, and tools that
help me improve the platform.

In full transparency: if donations exceed the site's needs, some of the funds may help support me
personally. That means covering basics like food or bills when needed, so I can continue focusing
time and energy on this project. But the main goal is keeping MinionAH alive and thriving.

## How Can You Donate?

You can support me through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/F1F04KOJQ), a platform where you can donate any
amount you like. Every bit helps, and I seriously appreciate it.
