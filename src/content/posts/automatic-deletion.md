After having over 600 auctions, it was time to add the much-requested feature of bumping auctions.
You can now bump your auctions to keep them active, so they won't get deleted after 14 days.

## Bumping

We've added the ability to bump your auctions. You can bump your auctions every 3 days. This makes
sures that potential buyers know that you're still selling the item and your auction won't get
deleted after 14 days.

## Automatic Deletion

Every day, we will check if an auction is inactive. Inactive means that the auction has not been
bumped in the last 14 days.

As this is a new feature, we will enable automatic deletion about a week after posting this blog
post. This gives everyone enough time to bump their auctions.

We will also send out notifications to everyone who has them enabled, to remind them to bump their
auctions.
