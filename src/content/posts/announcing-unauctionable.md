MinionAH turned 2 years old on July 9th, 2025. That was the day the very first lines of code were
written.

Starting with a modest user base in its early days, MinionAH has grown into the central hub for
Minion trading. With over 5,000 users and new auctions posted daily, it’s now the largest platform
of its kind.

Beyond simple trades, users run full-fledged Minion shops by listing their minions in a way that is
visible to everyone, regardless of their Discord server.

Since the launch of our [Discord bot](/discord-update), managing auctions has become even easier,
allowing users to create and update listings directly from Discord.

## Announcing Unauctionable

As life got busier, development on MinionAH slowed down. The current codebase has become difficult
to maintain, and adapting to modern standards is increasingly challenging.

We’ve received amazing suggestions from the community, including many features we _want_ to build.
However, the existing platform simply isn’t built for the future we envision.

Most importantly, we realized MinionAH is limited by design. It’s focused solely on minions, but the
SkyBlock community trades far more than that. Many valuable items are **unauctionable** in-game, yet
there’s no trusted, centralized place to trade them.

That’s where **Unauctionable** comes in.

We’re building a brand-new platform from the ground up:

- Modern, maintainable code
- Designed for **all** unauctionable items, not just minions
- Inspired by everything we’ve learned over the past 2 years

## What happens next?

MinionAH will gradually be rebranded as **Unauctionable**. You may have already noticed wording
changes, such as “create a new auction” instead of “create a new minion.”

**MinionAH will remain online until Unauctionable fully matches its feature set.** Once we're ready,
we’ll begin the migration process, and we aim to make it fully automated, so you won’t have to lift
a finger.

From this point forward, all development efforts will go into Unauctionable. MinionAH won’t receive
further updates.

## Timeline

We don’t have a timeline yet. In fact, development on Unauctionable hasn’t started. Right now, our
focus is on making sure that Unauctionable matches everything MinionAH currently offers.

Until then, we won’t be posting regular progress updates. Once Unauctionable reaches feature parity
with MinionAH, we will begin sharing updates about every new feature and change.
