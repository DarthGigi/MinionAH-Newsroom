After months of hard work, we are excited to announce the release of our Discord integration! This
update brings a lot of new features and improvements to MinionAH, including a Discord bot, a new
login notification method, and more!

## Table of Contents

## Discord Integration

We've added a new feature that allows you to link your Discord account to your MinionAH account.
This will allow you to receive notifications on Discord when you get a new message on MinionAH. You
can also use our bot to manage your auctions — more on that below.

To link your Discord account, go to your [profile settings](https://minionah.com/profile/settings),
click on "Connect your Discord account", follow the instructions, and you're good to go!

</div>

If you're skeptical about this integration, Discord will show you exactly which permissions we
request. If you're uncomfortable with any of them, you don't have to link your account.

## Notifications

We've overhauled the notification system — the old version was a bit clunky and not very
user-friendly.

We've removed the combined “Email & Device” option and also the "None" option. Instead, you can now
simply check or uncheck the methods you want to use to receive notifications.

As you can see, we've also added a new option: "Discord". This allows you to receive notifications
on Discord whenever you get a new message on MinionAH.

<div class="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/discord-update/discord-notification.png" class="max-h-192 mx-auto" alt="Discord notification"/>
</div>

Some notification options require additional setup. You can click the warning icon (⚠️) to see what
needs to be done and also test if everything is working as expected.

</div>

## Discord Bot

We've also released a Discord bot that lets you manage your auctions directly from Discord.

You can use the bot to:

- Create and delete auctions
- Browse auctions directly in Discord
- Check minion prices
- Receive notifications for new MinionAH messages
- And more features are coming soon!

<div class="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/discord-update/bot-discovery.png" class="max-h-192 mx-auto" alt="Bot discovery"/>
</div>

You can
[add the bot to your server and/or account](https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1276266745463705601)
and start using it right away.

## Miscellaneous

We've also made several smaller improvements and bug fixes. One of them is the new "Negotiable"
option on the auction creation page.

<div class="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/discord-update/negotiable-option.png" class="max-h-192 mx-auto" alt="Negotiable option"/>
</div>

This indicates that you're open to negotiation on the price of your auction.

</div>

We've also replaced the Skyblock coin icon with one that better fits the rest of the site's design.
