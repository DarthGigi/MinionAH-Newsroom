At the time of writing this, MinionAH has increased in popularity and usage, we have over 3,000 users now and the number is still growing! Truly, I can't thank you all enough for the support and love you've shown to MinionAH.

Since I've started working on MinionAH, I've done everything I can to keep the website running for free, but as the website grows, so do the costs of running it. For example, we had to move from our database provider to hosting our own database as we were hitting our free tier limits. This is just one of the many costs that come with running a website like MinionAH.

## Why Donations?
MinionAH is a free service, and I want to keep it that way. However, to keep the website running, I need to cover the costs of hosting, domain registration, and other expenses. Donations will help me cover these costs and allow me to continue improving MinionAH.

Currently, the only costs we have are the domain registration, which is about $10 per year. I have no problem covering this cost out of my own pocket, but as the website grows, so do the costs. I want to be transparent about the costs of running MinionAH and how donations will help cover them.

## What Will Donations Be Used For?
Currently, as said before, the only cost we have is the domain registration, and if we get enough donations, it will exceed the 10$ per year.  
This is why I will set aside the donations for future costs, and invest them into improving MinionAH. None of the donations will go to me personally, they will all be used to cover the costs of running MinionAH and improving it.
