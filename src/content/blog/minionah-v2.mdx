It has been a while since the last update announcement, which was the [Squashing Bugs Update](/squashing-bugs-update). However, this doesn't mean that we haven't been working on MinionAH. We have added a lot of new stuff and improved so many things, we just never told you about it. But now, we are here to tell you all about the v2 update for MinionAH!

## Table of Contents

## Smaller Changes

### Newsroom

Let's start with some basic stuff. The newsroom got a design overhaul, now it matches the theme and style of MinionAH. We also made some performance improvements, mainly with images and videos, they load a lot faster now. We also tweaked some animations.

### Stats

At the time of the last update, we didn't even have 50 users. Now, we are almost at 200 users _and_ auctions!

I just wanna say thank you to everyone who has been using the website and allowing me to make the trading of minions easier for the community, it means a lot to me!

## Chats

### Real-time Chat

The chat system is now real-time! When you and the other person are both online, the messages will be sent and received instantly. This is a huge improvement over the old system where you had to refresh the page to see new messages.

Discussing the time, price, or any other details of the trade is now a lot easier and faster when you're both online.

    <source src="/assets/videos/minionah-v2/real-time-chat.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

### Message Styling

The messaging engine has been rewritten from the ground up, it now supports some basic styling of messages. You can now make your messages **bold**, _italic_, <u>underlined</u>, and ~~strikethrough~~.

Just select a part of your message and click on the style you want to apply. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts `Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+I`, `Ctrl+U`, and `Ctrl+Shift+S` (Cmd on Mac) to apply the styles.

  <video muted loop autoplay class="mx-auto max-h-96 !w-auto" alt="Message styling">
    <source src="/assets/videos/minionah-v2/message-styles.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

### Images

You can now also send images, just click the image icon and paste the URL of the image you want to send.

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <video muted loop autoplay class="mx-auto max-h-96 !w-auto" alt="Sending images">
    <source src="/assets/videos/minionah-v2/image-chats.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

### Overview

The chat overview page has gotten a big redesign and the cards are now bigger and show more information. Buttons have also been labeled so you know what they do.

<BeforeAfter before="/assets/images/squashing-bugs-update/chats.png" after="/assets/images/minionah-v2/chats-overview.png" client:visible />

## Notifications

We have been working on a notification system for a while now, and it's finally here! You can now receive notifications for various events on MinionAH, mainly when someone sends you a message.

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/minionah-v2/notification-settings.png" alt="Notification settings" />
</div>

### Device Notifications

You can choose to receive notifications on your device when someone sends you a message. Your browser or phone will send you these notifications, so make sure you allow them when prompted.

On mobile, you can also add the website to your home screen to receive notifications, just like a native app. You will have to go through some extra steps to enable notifications on Apple devices, but it's worth it!

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/minionah-v2/ios-notification.jpeg" alt="Device notification" />
</div>

### Email Notifications

You can also choose to receive notifications via email. You will receive an email when someone sends you a message, even if you're not online.

To enable email notifications, go to your [profile settings](https://minionah.com/profile/settings) and add your email address, then go to your [notification settings](https://minionah.com/profile/settings/notifications) and enable email notifications.

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/minionah-v2/email-notification.png" alt="Email notification" />
</div>

## Profiles

User profiles got a big redesign, you can customize your profile with a bio and URLs to your social media accounts.

To get started, go to your [profile settings](https://minionah.com/profile/settings) and fill in the fields.

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/minionah-v2/profile-settings.png" alt="Profile settings" />
</div>

Then whenever someone visits your profile, they will see the redesigned profiles with your bio and social media links.

## QOL Improvements

### Alerts

Remember when you got that giant popup in your face when you added or deleted an auction and for other stuff as well? Yeah, that's gone now.

We have replaced it with a small toast notification that appears at the bottom of the screen. It's less intrusive and doesn't block the whole screen.

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/minionah-v2/toast-notification.png" alt="Toast notification" />
</div>

### Limits

The maximum amount of auctions you can have got doubled, from 9 to 18, and the number of minions you can have in a single auction got octupled, from 64 to 512.

### Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs show you where you are on MinionAH and allow you to quickly navigate back to a previous page.

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/minionah-v2/breadcrumbs.png" alt="Breadcrumbs" />
</div>

### Infinite Scroll

We have also added a new preference, infinite scroll. When enabled, MinionAH will load more auctions as you scroll down the page, so you no longer have to click the "Load More" button.

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/minionah-v2/preferences-scroll.png" alt="Infinite scroll" />
</div>

### Search

The search system has been redesigned, you no longer need to type your search query in the search bar, instead, you can choose a minion or a
user from the dropdown to search.

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <video muted loop autoplay class="mx-auto max-h-96 !w-auto" alt="Search bar">
    <source src="/assets/videos/minionah-v2/search.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

### A friendly bug

This little guy just popped up one day, and we decided to keep him. When you click on him, you can tell him about the other bugs you find on the website. He will let us know and we will fix them as soon as possible.

<div class="rounded-lg border border-border p-4">
  <video muted loop autoplay class="mx-auto max-h-96 !w-auto" alt="Bug report">
    <source src="/assets/videos/minionah-v2/bug.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

### Design Improvements

We have made a lot of design improvements, too many to list here. But enough to say that MinionAH looks a lot better now.

<MediaCarousel items={["/assets/images/minionah-v2/design-changes/minion-create.png", "/assets/images/minionah-v2/design-changes/minion-delete.png", "/assets/images/minionah-v2/design-changes/login.png", "/assets/images/minionah-v2/design-changes/signup.png"]} client:visible={{ rootMargin: "200px" }} />

## Under the Hood

There are a lot of changes under the hood as well, mainly performance improvements and bug fixes.

### Database

We have migrated to a new database, from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. This has improved the loading times by a lot

## Last Words
