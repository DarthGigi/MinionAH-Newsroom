We already had this system in place for a while, for example, when you hover over a minion card; you could see the price of the minion.

We also had an API for developers to get the price of any minion: <a href="https://minionah.com/api/craftcost/docs" target="_blank">RCC API</a>, but that's not so user-friendly now, is it? That's why we decided to add a dedicated page for it.

## Price Checker

You can easily see every minion's price based on their craft cost and tier. To quickly find the minion you're looking for, you can use the search at the top; just select the minion you want to see the price of, and you're done.

It even automatically sorts the minions based on their tier after you search!

<div class="border border-border rounded-lg p-4">

</div>

To make it even easier, you can also sort the minions by their type, craft cost, or tier. If you want more information about a minion, you can click on the 3 dots next to each minion to choose the wiki you want to visit for that minion.
