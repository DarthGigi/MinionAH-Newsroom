After months of hard work, we are excited to announce the release of our Discord integration! This update brings a lot of new features and improvements to MinionAH, including a Discord bot, a new login notification method, and more!

## Table of Contents

## Discord Integration
We have added a new feature that allows you to link your Discord account to your MinionAH account. This will allow you to receive notifications on Discord when you receive a new message on MinionAH. It will also allow you to use our bot to manage your auctions, more on that later.

To link your Discord account, go to your [profile settings](https://minionah.com/profile/settings) and click on the "Connect your Discord account", follow the instructions and you are good to go!

</div>

If you're skeptical about this integration, Discord shows you which permissions we request. So if you're uncomfortable with any of them, you don't have to link your account.

## Notifications
We've overhauled the notification system, as the old notification system was a bit clunky and not very user-friendly.

We've removed the merging of Email & Device option and also the "None" option. Instead, you can now check or uncheck the ways you want to receive notifications.

As you can see, we've also added a new option: "Discord". This will allow you to receive notifications on Discord when you receive a new message on MinionAH.

</div>

Some of the notification options require additional setup, you can click the warning icon (⚠️) to see what you need to do and also test if everything is working as expected.

</div>


## Discord Bot
We have also released a Discord bot that allows you to manage your auctions directly from Discord.

You can use the bot to:
 - Create and delete auctions
 - Browse all the auctions right from Discord
 - Check the prices of the minions
 - Receive notifications when you receive a new message on MinionAH
- And much more to come in the future!

</div>

You can [add the bot to your server and/or account](https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1276266745463705601) and start using it right away.

## Miscellaneous

We have also made a lot of other small improvements and bug fixes, one of them is the new "Negotiable" option in the auction creation page.

  <img src="/assets/images/discord-update/negotiable-option.png" class="max-h-192 w-auto! mx-auto" alt="Negotiable option"/>
</div>

This will indicate that you are open to negotiation on the price of your auction.

</div>

We've also replaced the Skyblock coin icon with a more fitting one that matches the rest of the site.
